# LoginAndReg
basic login and registration in CSharp 

This was a basic login and registration application that i wrote in coding camp at Coding Dojo. 
I am writing this README file sometime after camp so my memory
may not serve well. I believe this was the first project I used a Wrapper
on. I remember looking at ViewBag and Wrapper and deciding i wanted to take
the extra time to learn how to use the Wrapper. 

The ViewBag allows you to 
move information but the wrapper seemed like it would be a useful thing in the
long run to learn. ViewBag allows you to send information from your controllers
to your views. It is a dictionary that only perists over one view return and
not over redirects.
